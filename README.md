# SEAMS - School Event Attendance Management System

**SEAMS** is a simple app made with Windows Forms. It helps track student attendance using QR codes. This project was built with C#, DevExpress, and SQLite. Itâ€™s part of my personal effort to create an easy-to-use desktop tool.

## Project Goal

Build a full-featured windows form application where SSG officeers can:

- Create attendance
- Register student
- Generate qr code
- Scan qr code
- Track attendance record (absent, present)
